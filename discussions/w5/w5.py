"""
    An abstract data type consists of two types of functions:
    â€¢ Constructors: functions that build the abstract data type.
    â€¢ Selectors: functions that retrieve information from the data type.
    
    Abstract violation
    You should never assume anything about how the constructors and selectors for an abstract data type are implemented. Doing so is called a data abstraction violation.
    We assumed rationals were represented as lists instead of accessing their elements using the selectors.

    Eg:
    
    def rational(n, d):
        return [n, d]
    >>> frac1 = rational(3, 4)
    >>> frac2 = rational(5, 6)
    >>> frac1[0] * frac2[0]
